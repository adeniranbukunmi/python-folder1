# python database (mysal)
# to download mysql connector user: pip install mysql-connector if you use xamp
        # or
# pip install mysql-connector-python #if use are using mysql workbench

# my_con = sql.connect(host='127.0.0.1', user='root', passwd='olasunkanmi60@')  #this connection password must be the password you use to open your database(if the data is in your pc)(if it not inside your pc, the owner of the pc will give you the username of the pc for user and you will use the pc ip address in your host), but in an organization, it is the  admin that will give you  privileges to access the database and he\she will be the one to generate the user and password that will be used. also if the database is hosted on the cloud, you will copy the IP address of the hosting platform into host  NOTE THE VARIABLE NAME OF YOUR CONNECTION SHOULD BE 'mycon or my_con' e.g i used my_connection as variable name but it did not work it throw an error indicating wrong syntax
